# PROJECT: Getting a Good Night Sleep

## Project Description
 My mission is to analyze the lifestyle survey data with Python to discover relationships between exercise, gender, occupation, and sleep quality. See if i can identify patterns leading to insights on sleep quality.

 ## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Which occupation has the lowest average sleep duration? Save this in a string variable called lowest_sleep_occ.

2. Which occupation has the lowest average sleep quality? Save this in a string variable called lowest_sleep_quality_occ. Did the occupation with the lowest sleep duration also have the lowest sleep quality? If so assign a boolean value to variable same_occ variable, True if it is the same occupation, and False if it isn't.

3. Let's explore how BMI Category can affect sleep disorder rates. Start by finding what ratio of app users in each BMI Category have been diagnosed with Insomnia. Create a dictionary named: bmi_insomnia_ratios. The key should be the BMI Category as a string, while the value should be the ratio of people in this category with insomnia as a float rounded to two decimal places. Please note the keys are case-sensitive, and should be formatted as shown in the example dictionary.
